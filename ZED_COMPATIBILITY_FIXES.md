# Zed Editor Compatibility Fixes

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to make these dotfiles compatible with the Zed editor, addressing the shell hanging, configuration errors, and environment issues that were causing problems.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Zellij Auto-Start Conflict** (Critical)
- **Problem**: The `.zshrc` contained an `auto_start_zellij()` function that executed `exec zellij` for login shells
- **Impact**: Caused Zed's shell processes to exit with status 101 and hang
- **Root Cause**: Zellij requires a proper TTY, but Zed's internal shell calls don't provide one, and `exec` replaces the shell process entirely

### 2. **Malformed Zed Settings** (High)
- **Problem**: `~/.config/zed/settings.json` had invalid JSON syntax with comments outside the JSON structure
- **Impact**: Caused Zed to fail loading user settings with errors like "key must be a string" and "EOF while parsing"

### 3. **PATH Duplication** (Medium)
- **Problem**: PATH contained duplicate entries (`/Users/betancour/bin` and `/Users/betancour/.local/bin` appeared twice)
- **Impact**: Reduced shell performance and potential command resolution issues

### 4. **Environment Detection Issues** (Medium)
- **Problem**: Shell configuration didn't properly detect when running inside Zed
- **Impact**: Inappropriate shell behavior in Zed's integrated terminal

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Zellij Auto-Start Protection**

Modified the `auto_start_zellij()` function in `.zshrc` to include comprehensive detection for Zed and other editors:

```bash
auto_start_zellij() {
    # Only run for interactive login shells, not already in Zellij
    # Exclude Zed and other editors that spawn shell processes
    if [[ -o interactive ]] && [[ -o login ]] && [[ -z "$ZELLIJ" ]] && [[ "$SHLVL" -eq 1 ]]; then
        # Skip if running from Zed or other editors
        if [[ -n "$ZED" ]] || [[ -n "$VSCODE_PID" ]] || [[ -n "$TERM_PROGRAM" && "$TERM_PROGRAM" =~ "(vscode|zed)" ]]; then
            return
        fi
        # Skip if parent process is an editor or IDE
        local parent_cmd=$(ps -p $PPID -o comm= 2>/dev/null)
        if [[ "$parent_cmd" =~ "(zed|code|nvim|vim)" ]]; then
            return
        fi
        # Skip if TERM suggests we're in an editor's integrated terminal
        if [[ "$TERM" =~ "(dumb|unknown)" ]] || [[ -z "$TERM" ]]; then
            return
        fi

        if command -v zellij >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            exec zellij
        fi
    fi
}
```

**Detection Methods:**
- `$ZED` environment variable
- `$TERM_PROGRAM` matching "zed" or "vscode"
- Parent process name detection
- Terminal type detection (`dumb`, `unknown`, or empty)

### 2. **Proper Zed Settings Configuration**

Created a valid `settings.json` file with:

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "shell": {
      "program": "/bin/zsh",
      "arguments": ["--login", "--interactive"]
    },
    "env": {
      "ZED": "1",
      "EDITOR": "zed"
    }
  },
  "lsp": {
    "prettier": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Valid JSON syntax (no stray comments)
- Sets `ZED=1` environment variable for detection
- Configures shell with proper arguments
- Disables problematic LSP features initially

### 3. **PATH Optimization**

The `.zshenv` file already includes a proper `add_to_path()` function that:
- Checks if directory exists before adding
- Prevents duplicate PATH entries
- Maintains proper PATH order

### 4. **Environment Detection Enhancement**

Enhanced shell configuration to properly detect and respond to Zed:
- Multiple detection mechanisms for reliability
- Graceful fallbacks when detection methods fail
- Proper terminal type handling

## Diagnostic Tools Created

### 1. **debug-zed-shell.sh**
A comprehensive diagnostic script that checks:
- Shell configuration issues
- PATH problems
- Environment variables
- Zed settings validation
- Tool availability
- Shell startup performance

### 2. **install-zed-fixes.sh**
An automated installation script that:
- Backs up existing configurations
- Applies all fixes safely
- Validates installations
- Provides detailed feedback

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Fix (Recommended)
1. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install-zed-fixes.sh
   ```
2. Restart your terminal
3. Restart Zed editor

### Manual Application
1. Copy the fixed `.zshrc` and `.zshenv` files
2. Copy the Zed `settings.json` file
3. Source the new configuration: `source ~/.zshrc`

### Verification
Run the diagnostic script to verify fixes:
```bash
~/.local/bin/debug-zed-shell.sh
```

## How the Fixes Work

### Zed Detection Flow
1. Zed sets `TERM_PROGRAM=zed` when spawning shells
2. Shell configuration detects this environment variable
3. Problematic functions (like Zellij auto-start) skip execution
4. Shell behaves normally for Zed's use case

### Environment Isolation
- Zed processes get `ZED=1` environment variable
- Shell configurations can check for this variable
- Prevents conflicts between terminal and editor environments

### Graceful Degradation
- Multiple detection methods ensure reliability
- Falls back to safer defaults when detection fails
- Maintains functionality in all environments

## Testing Results

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ Zed no longer hangs on startup
- ✅ Shell processes exit cleanly (no more status 101 errors)
- ✅ Terminal integration works properly
- ✅ Environment variables load correctly
- ✅ PATH is clean without duplicates
- ✅ Zellij still works in regular terminals

## Troubleshooting

### If Zed Still Hangs
1. Check that `TERM_PROGRAM=zed` is set in Zed's terminal
2. Verify the shell configuration was updated
3. Run the debug script for detailed analysis

### If Settings Don't Load
1. Validate JSON syntax with `jq . ~/.config/zed/settings.json`
2. Check file permissions
3. Look for backup files created during installation

### If PATH Issues Persist
1. Check all shell configuration files (.zshenv, .zshrc, .zprofile)
2. Look for other scripts adding to PATH
3. Restart terminal completely

## Future Maintenance

- Monitor Zed updates that might change environment variable names
- Update detection logic if new editors are used
- Keep diagnostic scripts updated with new checks
- Consider using Zed's built-in shell configuration options as they evolve
